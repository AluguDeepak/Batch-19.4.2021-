    The Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India, drafted by a committee headed by B. R. Ambedkar, on 26 November 1949. India became a sovereign, democratic, republic after its constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950. Rajendra Prasad became the first President of India. The three words 'socialist','secular' and 'integrity' were added later with the 42nd Constitution Amendment 1976.
